Study Identifier	"MTBLS1"
Study Title	"A metabolomic study of urinary changes in type 2 diabetes in human compared to the control group"
Study Description	"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the result of a combination of impaired insulin secretion with reduced insulin sensitivity of target tissues. There are an estimated 150 million affected individuals worldwide, of whom a large proportion remains undiagnosed because of a lack of specific symptoms early in this disorder and inadequate diagnostics. In this study, NMR-based metabolomic analysis in conjunction with uni- and multivariate statistics was applied to examine the urinary metabolic changes in Human type 2 diabetes mellitus patients compared to the control group. The human population were un medicated diabetic patients who have good daily dietary control over their blood glucose concentrations by following the guidelines on diet issued by the American Diabetes Association. Note: This is part of a larger study, please refer to the original paper below."
