                "description": "TCDD is an environmental contaminant that elicits a number of hepatic effects including fat accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis that can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. RNA-Seq and targeted metabolomics were integrated with complementary dioxin response element (DRE) location and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ChIP-Seq data to further investigate the hepatotoxicity of TCDD. Our integrative analysis identified changes similar to the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells, including pyruvate kinase isoform switching (PKM1 to PKM2), and an increase in the glutaminase (GLS1) GAC:KGA isoform ratio. Consequently, metabolites are redirected towards the pentose phosphate pathway, serine biosynthesis, and glutaminolysis. We propose that the effects of TCDD on central carbon and amino acid metabolism represents AhR-mediated hepatic metabolic reprogramming in order to increase NADPH production as an oxidative stress counter-measure.",

                        "description": "The free induction decays for one-dimensional data were zero-filled to 64 k data points and multiplied by an exponential function with a line-broadening factor of 0.5 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. All one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were manually corrected for phase and baseline distortions using TOPSPIN 2.1 (BrukerBiospin) and referenced to the TSP signal at \u03b4 0.0 ppm. 1H NMR spectral regions \u03b4 0.5\u20139.0 were binned with a width of 0.004 ppm (2 Hz) using the AMIX package (v3.9.3, BrukerBiospin). </p> The 1H NMR spectra were normalized to the total sum of the spectral integrals to compensate for sample concentration differences. Subsequently, the multivariate data analyses were carried out using the SIMCA-P + software package (v12.0, Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden). Initially, the principal component analysis (PCA) of the 1H NMR spectral data was performed (on mean-centered data) to visualize the general structure of each data set and to identify any abnormalities (based on the principles of Hotelling T2) within the data set. Next, the supervised multivariate methods, projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) [1] was applied to the analysis of 1H NMR spectral data scaled to unit variance (UV) in order to uncover metabolic differences. O-PLS is an extension of the partial least square regression method featuring an integrated orthogonal signal correction filter [2]. The interpretation of the model is facilitated by a back-scaled transformation of the loadings, with incorporated color-coded correlation coefficients (MATLAB v7.1, The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA) of the metabolites responsible for the differentiation as described by Cloarec et al [3]. In short, each back-scaled loading is plotted as a function of the respective chemical shift with a color code that indicates the weights of the discriminatory variables. A hot color (red) corresponds to the metabolite being markedly different between classes, while a cool color (blue) corresponds to no differences between classes. </p> In order to validate and avoid the risk of over-fitting the PLS model, a sevenfold cross-validation was used, i.e. iterative construction of models by repeatedly leaving out one-seventh of the samples, and predicting them back into the model. This procedure results in a cross-validation parameter Q2, indicating the predictability of the model in relation to its statistical validity. An additional cross-validation tool, a permutation test, was performed for each model: 200 models were constructed with the use of randomized classification for the samples and Q2 generated from these models were compared to the Q2 of the real model. If the maximum value of Qmax2 from the permutation test was smaller than the Q2 of the real model, the model was regarded as a predictable model. Similarly, the R2 was used to evaluate possibly over-fitted models. A final significance test was performed with the use of a CV-ANOVA (analysis of variance of the cross-validated residuals) test to verify the models validity [4]. The models were only considered to be valid if the permutation test and the CV-ANOVA test were satisfied at the same time. </p> In order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the established models receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) of true positive rates were plotted as a function of false positive rates in SPSS using cross-validated Y prediction values. The subsequent areas of under the ROC curves were also calculated in SPSS. </p> Ref: </br> [1]. Bylesj\u00f6 M, Rantalainen M, Cloarec O, Nicholson JK, Holmes E, Trygg J.

For the comparisons between CD and controls, two samples contained 5-aminosalicylic acid and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and these samples were excluded from the analysis. The decision to exclude the two CD samples and thus keep the aromatic region in the remaining CD samples, as opposed to the UC samples, is based on the principle of keeping as many data as possible in order to generate valid results.

                "description": "This study employs spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling of fecal extracts from healthy subjects and patients with active or inactive ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) to substantiate the potential use of spectroscopy as a non-invasive diagnostic tool and to characterize the fecal metabolome in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Stool samples from 113 individuals (UC 48, CD 44, controls 21) were analyzed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker 600 MHz, Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Data were analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis using SIMCA-P plus 12 and MATLAB. Significant differences were found in the metabolic profiles making it possible to differentiate between active IBD and controls and between UC and CD. The metabolites holding differential power primarily belonged to a range of amino acids, microbiota-related short chain fatty acids, and lactate suggestive of an inflammation-driven malabsorption and dysbiosis of the normal bacterial ecology. However, removal of patients with intestinal surgery and anti-TNF-alpha antibody treatment eliminated the discriminative power regarding UC versus CD. This study consequently demonstrates that 1H NMR spectroscopy of fecal extracts is a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool and able to characterize the inflammation-driven changes in the metabolic profiles related to malabsorption and dysbiosis. Intestinal surgery and medication are to be accounted for in future studies, as it seems to be factors of importance in the discriminative process.",

The <strong>healthy volunteer subjects</strong> (n = 37) were recruited locally among the staff at Herlev Hospital and were free of any daily medications (see <strong>Tables 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>, in the paper associated with this study, for clinical details). Exclusion criteria were age above 80 or below 18 years; clinical evidence of any infections; recent (within 14 days) use of antibiotics, probiotics or high-dose prednisolone (\u226560 mg/day); pregnancy; severe mental illness; and special food regimens such as a diet of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, a diabetic diet or a gluten-free diet. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Classification of response to IFX:</strong></p><p>The outcome of <strong>IFX</strong> treatment was determined in accordance with previous studies<strong>[6][7]</strong>:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Remission (Rem)</strong> was defined as a favourable clinical response to <strong>IFX</strong> induction (<strong>Mayo score</strong> &lt;2, <strong>HB score</strong> &lt;5, <strong>PDAI score</strong> &lt;5), followed by a sustained clinical remission at the initiation of maintenance therapy, i.e. at wk 14.</p><p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Response (Res)</strong> was defined as a beneficial clinical response to <strong>IFX</strong> induction (reduced <strong>Mayo score</strong>, <strong>HB score</strong> and/or <strong>PDAI score</strong>) but without complete clinical remission (<strong>Mayo score</strong> \u22652, <strong>HB score</strong> \u22655, <strong>PDAI score</strong> \u22655) at initiation of maintenance therapy, i.e. at wk 14 and despite subsequent dose optimisation.</p><p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Non-response (NRes)</strong> was defined as no clinical response to <strong>IFX</strong> induction therapy at wk 2, 6 or 14.</p><p><br></p><p>Serum sample collection and preparation:</p><p>Blood samples were collected during the induction treatment with <strong>IFX</strong> and obtained as trough levels with sampling 30 min prior to an <strong>IFX</strong> infusion. Hence, samples were available from time-point 0 (before first infusion of <strong>IFX</strong>), 2 wk after the initial dose (before the 2nd infusion), 6 wk after the initial dose (before the 3rd infusion) and 14 wk after the initial dose (before continuing maintenance therapy, i.e. the 4th infusion). Patients with severe disease and no initial response to <strong>IFX</strong> treatment often never received their 3rd and 4th infusions of <strong>IFX</strong>. 1 sample was available from each control subject. In total, 359 samples were available for analysis from non-fasting patients and controls. Within 3 h of sampling, the serum was collected after centrifugation (2500 x g for 5 min at ambient temperature) and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Van Assche G, Dignass A, Panes J, Beaugerie L, Karagiannis J, Allez M, Ochsenk\u00fchn T, Orchard T, Rogler G, Louis E, Kupcinskas L, Mantzaris G, Travis S, Stange E; European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Projection to latent structures discriminant analysis <strong>(PLS-DA)</strong> and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis <strong>(O-PLS-DA)[5]</strong> were subsequently applied to the 1H NMR spectral data scaled to unit variance to discover metabolic differences. <strong>O-PLS</strong> is an extension of the partial least squares regression method, including an integrated orthogonal signal-correction filter<strong>[6]</strong>. As previously described<strong>[7]</strong>, analysis of the model is facilitated by a back-scaled transformation of the loadings, with incorporated colour-coded correlation coefficients (<strong>MATLAB v7.1</strong>, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) of the metabolites accountable for the differentiation. Briefly, each back-scaled loading is plotted as a function of the respective chemical shift with a colour code that signifies the weights of the discriminatory variables. A hot colour (e.g. red) signifies metabolites that are markedly different between groups, whereas a cool colour (e.g. blue) corresponds to no differences between groups.</p><p><br></p><p>To minimise the risk of overfitting and to validate the <strong>PLS</strong> models, a 7-fold cross-validation procedure was performed, involving iterative construction of models by repeatedly leaving out 1/7th of the samples and predicting them back into the model. This resulted in a cross-validation parameter, <strong>Q2</strong>, indicating the predictability of the model in relation to its statistical validity. Furthermore, a cross-validation procedure, a permutation test, was completed for each model, wherein 200 models were constructed with the use of randomised classification of the samples, and <strong>Q2</strong> values were generated from these models and compared with the <strong>Q2</strong> values of the real model. If the maximum value of <strong>Q2max</strong> from the permutation test was smaller than the <strong>Q2</strong> of the real model, the model was regarded as a predictable model. Similarly, <strong>R2</strong> was used to evaluate possibly overfitted models. Finally, with the use of an analysis of variance of the cross-validated residuals <strong>(CV-ANOVA)[8]</strong> test, a significance test was implemented to verify model validity. Only if the permutation test and the <strong>CV-ANOVA</strong> test were fulfilled at the same time were the models considered valid. The actual predictive value of each model was estimated with the use of receiver operating characteristics.</p><p><br></p><p>Correlation analyses between metabolites were performed with the use of the respective resonance peaks from the NMR spectra.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Dong F, Zhang L, Hao F, Tang H, Wang Y.

                "description": "<h4><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> One-third of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients show no response to infliximab (IFX) induction therapy, and approximately half of patients responding become unresponsive over time. Thus, identification of potential treatment response biomarkers are of great clinical significance. This study employs spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling of serum from patients with IBD treated with IFX and healthy subjects (1) to substantiate the use of spectroscopy as a semi-invasive diagnostic tool, (2) to identify potential biomarkers of treatment response and (3) to characterise the metabolic changes during management of patients with tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibitors.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS:</strong> Successive serum samples collected during IFX induction treatment (weeks 0, 2, 6 and 14) from 87 IBD patients and 37 controls were analysed by <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Data were analysed with principal components analysis and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis using SIMCA-P+ v12 and MATLAB.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Metabolic profiles were significantly different between active ulcerative colitis and controls, active Crohn's disease and controls, and quiescent Crohn's disease and controls. Metabolites holding differential power belonged primarily to lipids and phospholipids with proatherogenic characteristics and metabolites in the pyruvate metabolism, suggestive of an intense inflammation-driven energy demand. IBD patients not responding to IFX were identified as a potentially distinct group based on their metabolic profile, although no applicable response biomarkers could be singled out in the current setting.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy of serum samples is a powerful semi-invasive diagnostic tool in flaring IBD. With its use, we provide unique insights into the metabolic changes taking place during induction treatment with IFX. Of distinct clinical relevance is the identification of a reversible proatherogenic lipid profile in IBD patients with active disease, which partially explains the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with IBD.</h4>",

Animal care was strictly in accordance with the European Union Regulations, and the experimental protocols were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethical Research Committee of the University of Barcelona in accordance with current regulations for animal care and use for experimental purposes. After a 7-day acclimatization period receiving the standard diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein rodent diet), animals were randomly divided into two groups of 12 and 10 mice per group (Control and maslinic acid (MA), respectively). Control mice were fed with the standard diet, and the MA-treated group was fed with the same diet supplemented with 100 mg of MA/kg feed in order to mimic the effective concentration inhibiting colon cancer cell growth[1]. Animals were maintained for 12 h light/dark cycles, with free access to water and food. Throughout the 6-week treatment period, animals were observed for any signs of toxicity. At the end of the 6 weeks, the animals were starved overnight and anesthetized with volatile isoflurane (ESTEVE, Barcelona, Spain) before blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture. Immediately, blood was centrifuged at 600 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min to obtain serum samples, which were frozen at -80 \u00baC until processing. After blood extraction, mice were killed by an overdose of anesthesia. Maslinic acid (MA) extract used was a white powder comprising 98% maslinic acid and 2% oleanolic acid. </p> Ref:</b> [1] Reyes FJ, Centelles JJ, Lupianez JA, Cascante M (2Alpha,3beta)-2,3-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid, a new natural triterpene from Olea europea, induces caspase dependent apoptosis selectively in colon adenocarcinoma cells.

                "description": "Chemoprevention is a pragmatic approach to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in western countries. In this regard, maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from wax-like coatings of olives, is known to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines without affecting normal intestinal cells. The present study evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy and associated mechanisms of maslinic acid treatment on spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice. Twenty-two mice were randomized into 2 groups: control group and MA group, fed with a maslinic acid-supplemented diet for six weeks. MA treatment reduced total intestinal polyp formation by 45% (P<0.01). Putative molecular mechanisms associated with suppressing intestinal polyposis in Apc(Min/+) mice were investigated by comparing microarray expression profiles of MA-treated and control mice and by analyzing the serum metabolic profile using NMR techniques. The different expression phenotype induced by MA suggested that it exerts its chemopreventive action mainly by inhibiting cell-survival signaling and inflammation. These changes eventually induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the metabolic changes induced by MA treatment were associated with a protective profile against intestinal tumorigenesis. These results show the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of MA against intestinal tumor development in the Apc(Min/+) mice model, suggesting its chemopreventive potential against colorectal cancer.",

Briefly, ~100 mg tissue were pulverised with dry ice. 600 \u00b5l methanol:chloroform (2:1) was added and the samples were sonicated for 15 min. Water and chloroform were added (200 \u00b5l of each) and the samples centrifuged for 20 min. The resulting aqueous and organic layers were separated from the protein pellet. The organic layer was dried overnight in a fume hood whilst the aqueous extracts were evaporated to dryness using an evacuated centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). </p> Ref:</br> [1] Atherton HJ, Bailey NJ, Zhang W, Taylor J, Major H, Shockcor J, Clarke K, Griffin JL (2006) A combined 1H-NMR spectroscopy- and mass spectrometry-based metabolomic study of the PPAR-alpha null mutant mouse defines profound systemic changes in metabolism linked to the metabolic syndrome.

                "description": "Regulation between the fed and fasted state in mammals is partially controlled by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Expression of the receptor is high in liver, heart and skeletal muscle, but decreases with age. A combined 1H NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS metabolomic approach has been used to examine metabolism in liver, heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in PPAR-alpha null mice and wild type controls during ageing between 3-13 months. For the PPAR-alpha-null mouse multivariate statistics highlighted hepatic steatosis, reductions in the concentrations of glucose and glycogen in both liver and muscle tissue, and profound changes in lipid metabolism in each tissue, reflecting known expression targets of the PPAR-alpha receptor. Hepatic glycogen and glucose also decreased with age for both genotypes. These findings indicate the development of age related hepatic steatosis in the PPAR-alpha-null mouse, with the normal metabolic changes associated with ageing exacerbating changes associated with genotype. Furthermore, the combined metabolomic and multivariate statistics approach provides a robust method for examining the interaction between age and genotype. </p> The GC-MS assay for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS314.",

The Nanomate infusion mandrel was used to pierce the seal of each well before analysis, after which a fresh tip was prewetted by three repeat mixes of 6.5 \u03bcl of the sample and 5 \u03bcl was aspirated, followed by an air gap (1.5 \u03bcl). The tip was pressed against a fresh nozzle and the sample was dispensed using 0.3 psi nitrogen pressure. A voltage of 1.2 kV was used in positive mode and \u22121.5 kV in negative mode with an acquisition time of 72 s in both modes and a total analysis time of ~3 min per sample. The tip was discarded and replaced for each sample to minimise sample carry-over. Throughout the acquisition the sample plate was kept at 15 \u00b0C.",

The raw data were converted to .mzXML (using MSconvert[2] with peakpick level 1), parsed with R and 50 (scan from 20 to 70) spectra were averaged per sample using XCMS[1], with a signal cutoff at 2000. The files were aligned using the XCMS[1][3] grouping function using \u201cmzClust\u201d with a m/z-window of 22 ppm and a minimum coverage of 60%, giving 1699 signals. Isotopes were annotated using the CAMERA package in R with the following parameters (maxcharge = 1, ppm = 5, mzabs = 0.001, intval = c(\u201cinto\u201d), minfrac = 0.25)[3]. </p> Ref:</br> [1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.

                "description": "Evidence from several recent metabolomic studies suggests that increased concentrations of triacylglycerols (TAGs) with shorter (14-16 carbon atoms), saturated fatty acids are associated with insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although causality cannot be inferred from association studies, patients in whom the primary cause of insulin resistance can be genetically defined, offer unique opportunities to address this challenge. Therefore, we compared metabolite profiles in patients with congenital lipodystrophy or loss-of-function insulin resistance (INSR) mutations with healthy controls. The absence of significant differences in TAG species in the INSR group suggest that changes previously observed in epidemiological studies are not purely a consequence of insulin resistance. The presence of TAGs with lower carbon numbers and high saturation in patients with lipodystrophy suggests that these metabolite changes may be associated with primary adipose tissue dysfunction. The observed pattern of TAG species is indicative of increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL). To test this we investigated the distribution of these TAGs in lipoprotein fractions using size exclusion chromatography prior to mass spectrometry. This associated these TAGs with VLDL particles, and hence release of TAGs into the blood from the liver. To test further the hepatic origin of these TAGs we induced DNL in the mouse, comparing ob/ob and wild type mice on a chow or high fat diet, confirming that DNL induced an increase in relatively shorter, more saturated fatty acids. Overall, these studies highlight DNL in the pathogenesis of metabolic dyslipidaemia in states where energy intake exceeds the capacity of adipose tissue. </p> The protocols and data for mice samples are reported in current study MTBLS327.</br> The protocols and data for human samples are reported in study MTBLS162.",

Mass spectra data were acquired in profile mode over the 50-1200 m/z range with a mass resolution of 60,000 at mass 400 (FWHM) and a scan time of 0.5 s. In further experiments, the same samples were subjected to mass fragmentation analysis (FT HCD (10, 30 and 70 NCE), MS2) with an isolation width of 1 Da and 60,000 FWHM at 400 m/z. </p> Initially the mass spectrometer was calibrated using LTQ Velos ESI Positive Ion Calibration Solution (Thermo Scientific) and a mixture of metabolites (100 \u00b5g/ml uridine, nicotinic acid, tryptophan, hippuric acid and phenylalanine; ACROS organics) in water. Prior to sample analysis 10 pooled conditioning samples were injected. To determine chromatographic reproducibility of retention times and peak intensities, pooled samples were injected after every 10 sample injections throughout the experiment [1]. </p> Ref:</br> [1] Graham, S.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and approved by the Queen\u2019s University Belfast Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. Lean mice (n=12) received a standard laboratory diet, composed of 16.4% protein, 4.0% fat and 48.5% carbohydrate (3.0 kcal/g; Teklad global rodent diet, Envigo, UK) for 23 weeks from birth. For the final 6 weeks animals were injected with either saline (n=6) or a modified obestatin peptide N-PEGylated(Cys10, Cys13)obestatin (n=6; PEG-OB (Cys10, Cys13)) (GL Biochem, China) at 50nmol/kg/day. Injections were administered subcutaneously in the back of the neck at a volume of 10 ml/kg and the final weight range of the animals in each group was 25-33 g (saline) and 26-33 g (PEG-OB (Cys10, Cys13)). </p> In a separate experiment the effects of PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) were investigated in DIO mice (n=11) which received a standard laboratory diet until 4 weeks of age, thereafter they received a high fat diet (20.5% protein, 36.0% fat and 35.7% carbohydrate (5.49 kcal/g; Mouse Diet, 60% Fat Calories, BioServ, USA) for 19 weeks.

A peak threshold filter of 2.5 AU was applied and peak picking thresholds were set between 0.5 and 20 minutes. Data were normalised to all compounds by correcting for multiple features to determine a global scaling factor. An output table was subsequently generated to include paired m/z retention times and raw and normalised peak intensities for pools and individual samples. These metabolic features were exported to Simca 14 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) and data quality was assessed via visualisation of clustering of pools and sample replicates. PCA observations were indicative of good platform stability. UPLC-MS acquired data for all samples (lean and DIO) were subsequently reanalysed using Progenesis QI as previously described. </p> On the basis of normalised peak intensities, metabolic features were reduced by exclusion of those observations showing no change in magnitude (fold change = 1) and no significant statistical difference (P>0.05, students t-test). Metabolic features were reduced from 3819 to 736 and 3819 to 615 when PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated mice were compared within lean and DIO groups respectively. This was carried out to avoid over-fitting and to improve the model\u2019s predictive ability. Using the average value for each biological replicate the filtered metabolic features were exported to Simca 14 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate analysis. Data were mean centred, pareto scaled and grouped into PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated groups for analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures via partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The ions with the greatest influence on separation between PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated animals were highlighted by the S-plots.",

Objectives: This study investigated whether treatment with a stable obestatin analogue (PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) changed plasma metabolite levels firstly in lean and subsequently in diet-induced obesity (DIO) C57BL6/J mice. Method: Untargeted LC-HRMS metabolomics experiments were carried out in ESI+ mode with plasma extracts from both groups of animals. Data were normalised, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis performed and metabolites of interest putatively identified. Result: In lean mice, 39 metabolites were significantly changed by obestatin treatment and the majority of these were increased, including various C16 and C18 moieties of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and monoacylglycerol, along with vitamin A, vitamin D3, tyrosine, acetylcarnitine and 2alpha-(hydroxymethyl)-5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol. Decreased concentrations of glycolithocholic acid, 3-dehydroteasterone and various phospholipids were observed. In DIO mice, 25 metabolites were significantly affected and strikingly, the magnitudes of changes here were generally much greater in DIO mice than in lean mice, and in contrast, the majority of metabolite changes were decreases. Four metabolites affected in both groups included glycolithocholic acid, and three different long-chain (C18) phospholipid molecules (phosphatidylethanolamine, platelet activating factor (PAF), and monoacylglycerol). Metabolites exclusively affected in DIO mice included various phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and fatty acyls, as well as creatine and oxidised glutathione. Conclusion: This investigation demonstrates that obestatin treatment affects phospholipid turnover and influences lipid homeostasis, whilst providing convincing evidence that obestatin may be acting to ameliorate diet-induced impairments in lipid metabolism, and it may influence steroid, bile acid, PAF and glutathione metabolism.",

                        "description": "Metabolites were extracted from mouse fecal samples taken 12 weeks after birth and 8 weeks after transfer to LBNL using a methanol/sonication method. Briefly, portions of the homogenized samples were weighed and extracted with cold (-20 \u00b0C) methanol proportionally (1 ml solvent per 100 mg homogenate) in a microcentrifuge tube. The average weight of the homogenized fecal samples was 69.3 \u00b1 26.3 mg (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). 100 \u00b5l of each methanol extract was transferred to glass vials and dried in a speed-vac concentrator (Labconco CentriVap Benchtop Vacuum Concentrator; Kansas City, MO). Dried metabolite extracts were chemically derivatized using a modified version of the protocol used to create FiehnLib. Briefly, dried metabolite extracts were dried again to remove any residual water if they had been stored at -80 \u00b0C. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 \u00b5l of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/ml) was added to each sample, followed by vortexing for 30 s and incubation at 37 \u00b0C with generous shaking (1000 rpm) for 90 min. At this point, the sample vials were inverted one time to capture any condensation of solvent at the cap surface, followed by a brief centrifugation at 1000 x g for 1 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 \u00b5l of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1 % trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were then added to each vial, followed by vortexing for 10 s and incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (1000 rpm) for 30 min. Again, the sample vials were inverted one time, followed by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 min.",

Retention indices (RI) of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution. Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites (Level 2 identifications). The three most abundant fragment ions in the spectra of each identified metabolite were automatically determined by Metabolite Detector, and their summed abundances were integrated across the GC elution profile; fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance.",

                "description": "Although the gut microbiome plays important roles in host physiology, health and disease, we lack understanding of the complex interplay between host genetics and early life environment on the microbial and metabolic composition of the gut. We used the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross mouse system to discover that early life history impacts the microbiome composition, whereas dietary changes have only a moderate effect. By contrast, the gut metabolome was shaped mostly by diet, with specific non-dietary metabolites explained by microbial metabolism. Quantitative trait analysis identified mouse genetic trait loci (QTL) that impact the abundances of specific microbes. Human orthologues of genes in the mouse QTL are implicated in gastrointestinal cancer. Additionally, genes located in mouse QTL for Lactobacillales abundance are implicated in arthritis, rheumatic disease and diabetes. Furthermore, Lactobacillales abundance was predictive of higher host T-helper cell counts, suggesting an important link between Lactobacillales and host adaptive immunity. Correlations between specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and B-cell counts, body weight and neuromuscular function (rotarod performance) were also observed. This study is the first to determine and rank the complex contributions of built environment, host genetics and diet in shaping gut microbial and metabolite composition, host fitness and behavior.",

This should be helpful for establishing causal relationships between exposure and adverse events. The statistical modelling revealed clustering of the classes, distinguished by metabolic biomarkers. The identified metabolites were subjected to metabolic pathway enrichment, modelling adverse biological events using available databases. Perturbation of metabolites involved in COPD, cardiovascular diseases and cancer were identified. Combining multiplatform metabolic phenotyping with knowledge-based mapping gives mechanistic insights into disease development which can be applied to next-generation tobacco/ nicotine products for risk assessment. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS assay</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS364' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS364</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>NMR assay</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS374' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS374</strong></a>.</p>",

Blood and urine were taken for quantitative NAD+ metabolomic analysis. He took 0.25 g of NA to assess sensitivity to flushing and self-reported painful flushing that lasted 1 hr. No flushing was experienced on NR. The study was submitted for approval by the University of Iowa institutional review board (IRB), which ruled it not subject to human subjects research on the basis of informed self-administration [1]. </p> Clinical trial:</br> A randomized, double-blind, three-arm crossover pharmacokinetic study of oral NR chloride was performed at 100, 300, and 1000 mg doses (NCT02191462). Twelve healthy, non-pregnant subjects (6 male, 6 female) between the ages of 30 and 55 with body mass indices of 18.5 - 29.9 kg/m2 were recruited and randomized to one of three treatment sequences after screening, passing eligibility criteria and providing informed consent. Subjects taking multi-vitamins, vitamin B3 in any form, or consuming diets that could contain unusually high amounts of NA, Nam or NR were excluded. Complete exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Materials. Overnight fasted subjects received a single morning dose of either 100 mg, 300 mg, or 1000 mg of NR on three test days separated by 7-day periods in which no supplement was given. To evaluate pharmacokinetics, blood was collected and separated into plasma and PBMC fractions for analysis of the NAD+ metabolome at pre-dose and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hr. Urine was collected pre-dose and in 0 - 6 hr, 6 -12 hr and 12 - 24 hr fractions. Safety, vitals, biometrics, complete blood counts and a comprehensive metabolic panel were assessed at time zero and 24 hr after each dose. </p> The study was reviewed and approved by the Natural Health Products Directorate, Health Canada and IRB Services, Aurora, Ontario. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject at the screening visit prior to all study-related activities. </p> Mice:</br> For gavage experiments, 12 week old male C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed 3 - 5 mice per cage on a chow diet (Teklad 7013) for one week prior to the experiment. Body weight-matched groups were randomly assigned to be given either 185 mg NR Cl /kg body weight (n = 3) or equimole amounts of NA (n = 4) or Nam (n = 4) by saline gavage. On each sacrifice day, a saline injection (n = 3) was performed and served as time point zero and an additional saline gavage (n = 3) time course was performed. To avoid circadian effects, time courses were established such that all sacrifices were performed at ~ 2 pm. With protocols approved by the University of Iowa Office of Animal Resources, mice were live-decapitated and the medullary lobe of the liver was freeze-clamped at liquid nitrogen temperature. For IP experiments, 6 - 8 week old, male C57Bl/6J mice were injected with either phosphate buffered saline or 500 mg NR Cl /kg body weight for six days. With protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Utah, mice were anesthetized by chloral hydrate and the liver and hearts were freeze-clamped at liquid nitrogen temperature. Tissues were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. </p> Ref:</br> [1] Altman, L. K. Who Goes First: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine. (University of California Press, 1987).",

                        "description": "Dual extractions were carried out for complete analysis of the NAD+ metabolome. For analysis of NR, Nam, NA, MeNam, Me2PY, and Me4PY (group A analytes or Acid group), samples were spiked with 60 pmol of [18O1]-Nam, [18O1]-NR, and [D3, 18O1]-MeNam and 240 pmol [D4]-NA (internal standard (IS) A). For analysis of NAD+, NADP+, NMN, NAR, NAMN, NAAD, and ADPR (group B analytes or Alkaline group), samples were dosed with 13C-yeast extract (IS B) as described [1]. For both human and mouse samples, samples were transferred to Waters polypropylene plastic total recovery vials (Part no. 186002639) after extraction or preparation and stored in a Waters Acquity H class autosampler maintained at 8 \u00b0C until injection. In all cases, 10 \u00b5l of extract was loaded onto the column. </p> Human Samples:</br> 100 \u00b5l of urine was mixed with 20 \u00b5l of IS A in 5% (v/v) formic acid or IS B in water for the analysis of group A and B analytes, respectively. 50 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol was added and the mixture vortexed prior to centrifugation at 16.1 kg at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. Supernatants were injected without further dilution and analyzed as described below. Standard curves and quality controls for the complete analysis were prepared in the same manner as described for urine samples but in water.</br> To quantify group A analytes in plasma, 100 \u00b5l of plasma was added to 20 \u00b5l of IS A prepared in 5% (v/v) formic acid and mixed with 400 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol. The mixture was allowed to sit on ice for 20 min then centrifuged as described for urine. After drying under vacuum overnight at 35 \u00b0C, the sample was reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l of water. To quantify group B analytes, 100 \u00b5l of plasma was added to 10 \u00b5l of IS B in water and mixed with 300 \u00b5l of acetonitrile with vortexing for 15 sec. After briefly resting on ice, the samples were centrifuged as above. Supernatants were applied to Phenomenex Phree SPE cartridges (Torrance, California, USA) and the flow-through collected. 200 \u00b5l of aqueous acetonitrile (4 volumes acetonitrile:1 volume water) was also applied and the flow through collected. The flow-through from both steps was combined and dried via speed vacuum. Samples were reconstituted in 60 \u00b5l of water. Standard curves and quality controls for both analyses were prepared in donor plasma (University of Iowa DeGowin Blood Center, Iowa City, IA, USA) and extracted using the same method employed for plasma samples. Blood cell fractions were thawed on ice and simultaneously extracted for both A and B analyses when possible. 100 \u00b5l of sample was added to either 20 \u00b5l of IS A in 5% formic acid (v/v) or 10 \u00b5l IS B in water for quantification of group A and B analytes, respectively. Samples were then mixed with 300 \u00b5l of acetonitrile and vortexed for 15 sec. Samples were shaken for 5 min at 40 \u00b0C then centrifuged as described above. For group A analytes, supernatants were dried via speed vacuum overnight at 35 \u00b0C after this step. For group B analytes, supernatant was applied to Phenomenex Phree SPE cartridges and treated in the same manner as described above for quantification of group B analytes in plasma. Immediately prior to analysis, samples were reconstituted in either 100 \u00b5l of 10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid (for group A analyte quantification) or 100 \u00b5l of 5% (v/v) aqueous methanol (for group B analyte quantification). Standard curves were prepared in water and processed in the same manner as samples. </p> Murine Samples:</br> Murine liver and heart obtained by freeze-clamp was pulverized using a Bessman pulverizer (100 \u2013 1000 mg size) (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, California) cooled to liquid N2 temperatures. Each pulverized liver and heart sample was aliquoted (5 \u2013 20 mg) into two liquid N2 cooled 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, which were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Prior to extraction, IS A and IS B were added to separate aliquots resting on dry ice for quantification of group A and B analytes, respectively. Samples were extracted by addition of 0.1 ml of buffered ethanol (3 volumes ethanol: 1 volume 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.1) at 80 \u00b0C. Samples were vortexed vigorously until thawed, sonicated in a bath sonicator (10 sec followed by 15 sec on ice, repeated twice for liver and thrice for heart), vortexed, then placed into a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) set to 80 \u00b0C and shaken at 1050 rpm for five min. Samples were centrifuged as described above. Clarified supernatants were transferred to fresh 1.5 ml tubes and dried via speed vacuum for two h. Prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, samples were resuspended in 40 \u00b5l of 10 mM ammonium acetate (>99% pure) in LCMS-grade water. Sample preparation following [13C1, D1]-NR administration differed only in the following respect. 60 pmol of [D4]-Nam and [D3, 18O1]-MeNam and 240 pmol of [D4]-NA was added to sample in lieu of IS A. Standard curves were performed without extraction in water.</br> </p> Ref:</br> [1] Trammell SA, Brenner C. Targeted, LCMS-based Metabolomics for Quantitative Measurement of NAD(+) Metabolites.

MeNam, Me2PY, and Me4PY were added to the analysis and detected using the following transitions: MeNam (m/z 137 > 94, cone voltage = 8 V, collision energy = 20 V); Me2PY (m/z 153 > 107, cone voltage = 44 V, collision energy = 22 V); and Me4PY (m/z 153 > 136, cone voltage = 24 V, collision energy = 14 V).</br> For the analysis of urine, plasma, and murine liver, group A analytes were separated as described for the acid separation. In blood cells, group A analytes were separated on a 2.1 x 150 mm Synergy Fusion-RP (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, US) using the same gradient and mobile phase as described for the acid separation. For human samples, group B analytes were separated using the mobile phase and gradient as previously described for the alkaline separation. Murine liver extracts were analyzed using a slightly altered alkaline separation on a 2.1 x 100 mm Thermo Hypercarb column. Specifically, flow rate was increased to 0.55 ml/min and run time shortened to 11.6 min. Separation was performed using a modified gradient with initial equilibration at 3% B, a 0.9 min hold, a gradient to 50% B over 6.3 min, followed by a 1 min wash at 90% B and a 3 min re-equilibration at 3% B. </p> Ref:</br> [1] Trammell SA, Brenner C.

                "description": "Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is in wide use as an NAD+ precursor vitamin. Here we conducted experiments to determine the time and dose-dependent effects of NR on blood, liver and heart NAD+ metabolism in people and mice. We report that human blood cell NAD+ can rise as much as 2.7-fold with a single dose of NR, that NR elevates mouse hepatic NAD+ with distinct and superior pharmacokinetics to those of nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (Nam), and that single doses of 100, 300, and 1000 mg of NR provide a dose-dependent increase in the blood cell NAD+ metabolome in the first clinical trial of NR pharmacokinetics. We also report that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), which was not thought to be en route for conversion of NR to NAD+, is formed from NR and that the rise in NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of effective NAD+ supplementation.",
