Study Title	Transcriptomic dynamics control rapid transition of core crop functions in 'lactating' pigeon
Study Description	<p>Pigeons (Columba livia) are widely kept as domesticated pets worldwide, and may have adapted to captivity through the evolutionarily specialized ability to produce ‘milk’ in the crops of both male and female parents via rapid proliferation and shedding of lipid- and protein-enriched epithelial cells. Given the implications for understanding evolution in atricial species, a comprehensive transcriptomic perspective of the pigeon crop spanning the complete breeding cycle is warranted. Here, we generated a de novo pigeon genome assembly to construct a high resolution spatio-temporal transcriptomic landscape of the crop epithelium across the entire breeding cycle. This multi-omics analysis identified a set of ‘lactation’-related genes involved in lipid and protein metabolism that are highly expressed in the crop. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed extensive reorganization of long-range promoter-enhancer interactions linked to the dynamic expression of these ‘lactation’-related genes between stages. Moreover, their expression is spatially localized in specific epithelial layers, and can be correlated with phenotypic changes in the crop. This study thus illustrates the preferential de novo synthesis of ‘milk’ lipids and proteins in the crop epithelium prior to shedding from the lumen, and provides candidate enhancer loci for further investigation of the regulatory elements controlling pigeon ‘lactation’. Furthermore, these comprehensive datasets provide a foundational resource for avian and evolutionary biology research, especially relevant to atricial reproductive biology.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>LC-MS-based metabolomics was performed on male and female pigeon milk at representative nurturing stages (timepoints), including day 1 of 3 female pigeons and 9 male pigeons, and day 19 of 9 male pigeons. After sacrificed, the crop contents (i.e., a mixture of pigeon milk and grain) were sampled, after straining the grain through the gauze, the pigeon milk was stored at -80 °C for further analysis.</p>	<p>Pigeon milk was homogenized in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar and aliquots of 100 +/- 5 mg were weighed into pre-cooled 2 mL round bottom tubes.&nbsp;After addition of 200 μL methanol:water (4:1, v/v), pre-cooled at -40 °C, the samples were immediately vortexed for 15 s, sonicated for 15 min at 20 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 19,000 x g. The supernatants were transferred to new 2 mL tubes and the remaining pellets subjected to a second extraction using 200 μL methanol:water (4:1, v/v).&nbsp;The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge at 30 °C, thoroughly reconstituted in 200 μL methanol:water (3:7, v/v), and filtered using 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filters.</p>	<p>Chromatographic separations were performed on an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) equipped with a HSS T3 column (100 x 1.0 mm, particle size 1.8 μm, Waters) applying the following binary gradient at a flow rate of 150 μL/min: 0.0-1.0 min, isocratic 95% A (water:formic acid, 99.9:0.1, v/v), 5% B (acetonitrile:formic acid, 99.9:0.1, v/v); 1.0-16.0 min, linear from 5 to 45% B; 16.0-18.0 min, isocratic 95% B; 18.0-20.0 min, isocratic 5% B. The injection volume was 3.0 μL (full loop injection).</p>	<p>Eluting compounds were detected between 100-1000 m/z using a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (Xevo G2-XS QTOF, Waters, UK) with an Apollo II electrospray ion source in positive and negative ion mode using following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.4 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 L/min, 190 °C; capillary, -5000 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 V; funnel 2 RF, 200 V; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 V; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV; collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy, 7 eV; collision RF 150/350 V (timing 50/50); transfer time, 70 μs; pre pulse storage, 5 μs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; spectra rate, 3 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode. Mass calibration of individual raw data files was performed on lithium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 μL 10 mM lithium hydroxide in isopropanol:water:formic acid, 49.9:49.9:0.2 (v/v/v), at a gradient time of 18 min using a diverter valve.</p>	<p>Raw data files were converted to <strong>mzData</strong> format using the vendor-specific <strong>CompassXport</strong> (http://www.bdal.de/) and processed using the <strong>XCMS</strong> package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html). <strong>XCMS</strong> settings for processing LC-MS data with findPeaks.centWave() were prefilter=(3,200); snthr=5; ppm=25; peak width=(5,12). For alignment group, Density() function with parameters minfrac=0.75 and bw=2 was used.</p>	<p>The individual compound mass spectra were reconstructed and features annotated as cluster ion, quasimolecular ion or in-source fragment ion. Afterwards, targeted CID-MS/MS experiments of quasimolecular ions (MS2) were performed using QTOF-MS. Based on accurate mass measurements, putative elemental compositions were calculated, filtered by isotope abundance and the number of double bond equivalents and electron parity, and checked for consistency in relation to elemental compositions calculated for fragment ions and observed neutral losses. Identification was based on reference</p>
